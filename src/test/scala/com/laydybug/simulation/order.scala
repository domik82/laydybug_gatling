class order extends Simulation {

//  Implemented scenario has two Actors:
//  As a client place order for 2 products
//  As a employee accept this order


//  TODO: 1. In ideal world such scenario should work in a fashion where users would have random orders with random product amount
//        This is not the case here - I used order_request_example.txt to execute request with 2 products
//        I thought that learning how to create proper json is not the case here (it can be done other time)
//        2. Confirm product by employee has "assumption"/"workaround" - because lack of time I didn't had chance to implement paging
//        Instead I used trick to get 500/1000 orders on single page. The problem with that approach is that once all orders on first page
//        will be confirmed test will start to fail
//        3. There is no proper exit/fail fast strategy - sometimes test fails in random manner and threads keep working
//        This should be fixed to avoid exceptions in build log
//        4. Observations during programming can be found in timeEaters.txt file. Right now I would say that writing tests
//        in this framework is complicated especially when some "random" issue will show up.
//        Scala tutorial would probably be helpful.
//        There were multiple issues without any clear solution that could be easily found in documentation
